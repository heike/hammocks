<h1>Background: Parallel Coordinate Plots</h1>
One application of parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) is to allow visualization of multi-dimensional data. 
For each dimension (variable) a vertical axis is drawn. For a dataset of three variables, there
would be 3 verical axis drawn. Each record is represented by a polyline that
intersects each axis at the observed value.

<h1>Parallel Sets</h1>
Parallel sets (also know as hammock plots) are similar to PCPs in the construction of axes. When displaying 
records, parallel sets treats
each segment of the polyline independently. The thickness of a segment indicates the number of records
that share the same set of observations, and the ends of that segment intersect the axis at the observed values.

<h1>Common angles</h1>
Common angle plots also treat each segment independently, with line thickness a measure of the number of records
reported that have common observed values. Additional structure is imposed by limiting the possible angles a connecting 
segment may display. An offset is employed, so that all line segments intersect the  axis at a 90-degree angle.
